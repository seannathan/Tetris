README: Tetris (snathan)

HANDIN: This is my first and hopefully only handin. This handin is early

DESIGN CHOICES:

I wrote Tetris with the following classes:App, PaneOrganizer, Tetris, Piece, TetrisSquare, Constants

App: Mainline blah blah blah

PaneOrganizer: Create my five panes.3 content panes are the GamePane, Bottom Pane(quit button), and Right Pane(labels with score, tetris, store option, next piece, etc. along with instructions).

Tetris: This class is my main class regarding my game and it's logic.
	
	Tetris Constructor: Takes in the gamePane, and a bunch of labels that relate back to the GUI. I set Focus, 
			    instantiate a new movehandler, build the board, make my logic board, and create my
			    gameOver label. I then construct my _nextPiece and set its type and then start my timeline.


	buildBoard(): Builds the background board for the game.

	blackoutBoard(): builds the blacked out board for gameOver.

	setupTimeline(): self- explanatory. My duration speeds up every time 12 lines are cleared so the difficulty is 
			 constantly increasing by a factor of 15% each time.

	TimeHandler(): This handles most of my action throughout the game. Creates pieces constantly; checks for full
		       lines, and then clears if necessary; speeds up duration based off lines cleared; keeps score 
		       based off consecutively cleared lines. Updates the score, Tetris #, and linesCleared #. Then 
		       constantly checks for whether the game is ending. If the game is over, the board gets blacked 
		       out and Game Over appears.

	MoveHandler(): Handles all my moves (Left, Right, Rotate, Drop, Hard Drop, Store, Pause). Then consumes event.

	clearLine(i): clears lines and moves all rows above down

	removeAllSquares(): removes all squares graphically from board

	storePiece(): stores a piece for later use and can press the same button to recall the piece and switch with 
		      current.

	showNextPiece(): shows which piece comes after the current Piece.

Piece: This is my main class regarding piece manipulation and creating the squares graphically 

	Piece Constructor: Takes in the gamePane and logicBoard as parameters

	show(): shows the piece on the board graphically

	converttoInd(): converts pix to index

	setPieceType(): sets the type of piece and then generates it at the same location at the top of the board
			so that the piece starts falling.

	getPieceType(): returns the number associated with the piece for knowing which piece comes next and which
			pieces are stored.

	rotate(): rotates the pieces based off the algorithm given in the handout

	rotatePossible(): checks whether rotation is possible by rotating and then checking whether the index is open
			  at the new hypothetical position.

	moveLeft(): moves the squares left by Constants.SQUARE_SIDE pixels (Constant)

	canMoveLeft(): checks whether the piece can move left before moving left

	moveRight(): moves piece right by Constants.SQUARE_SIDE pix

	canMoveRight(): checks whether the move right is legal before performing the move

	moveDown(): moves the piece down by Constants.SQUARE_SIDE pix
	
	canMoveDown(): checks whether the move down is legal or whether piece would intersect with another piece

	dropPiece(): if canMoveDown, moves down, otherwise converts position to index and sets the logic board 

	setPiece(): sets the piece to the logic board. redundant to drop piece but after a while of coding
		    both are used and the program works so I'm just gonna leave it there for now.

	fullDrop(): while can move down true, constantly move down until no longer able

	removePiece(): remove piece from screen graphically square by square.

TetrisSquare: Class that constructs each individual square for a piece
	
	TetrisSquare constructor: constructs generic square with stroke black

	getNode(): gets the square for graphical use

	setFill(): sets fill

	setX(): sets x position

	setY(): sets y position

	getY(): gets Y position

	getX(): gets x position

	getSquare(): gets the square

	getColor(): gets the fill (not sure if i actually used this)

Constants: Self explanatory. Contain the array coordinates used to create each of the 7 pieces. 

KNOWN BUGS:       My store piece methodology preserves the position of the piece stored when stored. Therefore, 
		  if you play the game and get close to the top and then try to get a piece you stored that was close to 
		  the bottom when stored, it will graphically sit on the board, but not logically affect the game.
